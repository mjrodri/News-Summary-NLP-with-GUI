# News-Summary-NLP-with-GUI
This Python script creates a user-friendly GUI using tkinter for summarizing news articles. It employs natural language processing tools like nltk and TextBlob, allowing users to input a news article URL, click the "Summarize" button, and receive a quick overview of the article's title, author, publication date, summary, and sentiment analysis.
